2,Beef Burger,"DIRECTIONS:

1. In a large bowl, mix ground beef, onion powder, salt and pepper until just combined. Do not overmix, or your patties will be tough.
Form patties, without pressing too hard. They should be uniform in thickness. Smooth out any cracks using your fingers. Make these right before you grill them, so they stay at room temperature.

2. Preheat your grill, grill pan or cast-iron skillet to high heat and add burger patties. If using a grill, cover with the lid.

3. Cook until the crust that forms on the bottom of the burger releases it from the pan or grate — about 2 minutes. Gently test, but don't flip it until it gets to this point. When burgers lift up easily, flip, add two slices of cheese to each, close lid if using a grill, and cook on the other side for another 2-3 minutes for medium to medium rare.

4. Add cookie dough mixture in dollops into the food processor with the ice cream.
Pulse a couple times.

5. Remove from food processor, feel free to top with 1 tbsp of chocolate chips, crushed nuts, and/or shredded coconut and serve.

6. Individual Ice Cream Cake Directions – If you are making the individual cookie dough ice cream cakes simply place blended mixture into your ice cream sandwich molds and freeze overnight.
Immediately before serving remove from ice cream sandwich molds, place onto a plate, add coconut whipped cream and chocolate ganache if desired.

7. Cookie Dough Blizzard on a Stick Directions – Place mixture into popsicle molds and freeze overnight. Serve immediately out of the freezer as these get soft quickly.",5,9,4,,http://lh4.ggpht.com/TtBlIbgsphbDWYErvyTM7LFY7qrb3_yHFRuzlLvUMXNhPhJBuwR8AiD1tWCw8Zzk4HnB4rL1R3mzrL8wqH-G=s730-c-e365
17,Vegan Cheesecake,"DIRECTIONS:

1. Add dates to a food processor and blend until small bits remain and it forms into a ball. Remove and set aside.

2. Next add nuts and process into a meal. Then add dates back in and blend until a loose dough forms - it should stick together when you squeeze a bit between your fingers. If it's too dry, add a few more dates through the spout while processing. If too wet, add more almond or walnut meal. Optional: add a pinch of salt to taste.

3. Lightly grease a standard, 12 slot muffin tin. To make removing the cheesecakes easier, cut strips of parchment paper and lay them in the slots. This creates little tabs that makes removing them easier to pop out once frozen.

4. Next scoop in heaping 1 Tbsp amounts of crust and press with fingers. To pack it down, use a small glass or the back of a spoon to compact it and really press it down. I found the bottom of a glass works well. If it sticks, separate the crust and the glass with a small piece of parchment. Set in freezer to firm up.

5. Add all filling ingredients to a blender and mix until very smooth. For the coconut milk, I like to scoop the ""cream"" off the top because it provides a richer texture. But if yours is already all mixed together, just add it in as is.

6. You don't need a Vitamix for this recipe, just a quality blender. I mixed mine for 1 minute, then ""liquified"" or ""pureed"" it until silky smooth. If it won't come together, add a touch more lemon juice or agave or a splash more coconut milk liquid as the liquid should help it blend better.

7. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. If adding peanut butter, add to the blender and mix until thoroughly combined. If flavoring with blueberry or caramel, wait and swirl on top of plain cheesecakes (optional).

8. Divide filling evenly among the muffin tins. Tap a few times to release any air bubbles, then cover with plastic wrap and freeze until hard - about 4-6 hours.

9. Once set, remove by tugging on the tabs or loosening them with a butter knife. They should pop right out. Add more caramel or top with whipped coconut cream if you desire.  Keep in the freezer for up to 1-2 weeks.
Optional: you can set them out for 10 minutes before serving to soften.",20,8,5,,http://lh3.ggpht.com/jFibUDTVTnJxIMu16XJqefs0ktisHcjHANtP3BEyS6Zm1IOw3wp849aJa4N9DHuoZJIWBt6ZGVP5rYsm4a_3hA=s730-c-e365
18,Sushi Rolls,"DIRECTIONS:

1. Rinse the rice in cold water while stirring briskly to remove any dirt. Drain the rice completely. Place the rice and the 6 cups of water in a medium sized saucepan and cover it with a tight fitting lid. Bring the water to a boil over medium heat. Allow the water to boil for 3 minutes and then reduce the heat to low and continue cooking 15 minutes without removing the lid. Remove the rice from the heat and remove the lid (the water should no longer be visible). Turn the rice out evenly on a well-greased cookie sheet using a spatula or rice paddle. Sprinkle the rice with the vinegar, sugar, and salt while mixing with a spatula or rice paddle until the rice reaches body temperature. Keep the rice covered with damp paper towels or napkin until the rice is ready to use.

2. Place a nori sheet lengthwise on a bamboo rolling mat, shiny-side down. Position the sheet about 1-inch from the edge of the mat closest to you and leave some of the bamboo mat exposed on either side of the nori sheet. 

3. Wet your hands in cool water and take a handful of sushi rice. Place the rice in the center of the nori and use your fingers to spread the rice evenly over the nori. Be sure to leave a 3/4-inch strip of nori uncovered on the far side. 

4. Place tuna strips and some julienne vegetable, cucumber or avocado along the center of the rice. Be careful not to overfill the nori. Place your fingertips over the fillings to hold them in place. Then, use your thumbs to lift up the edge of the bamboo rolling mat closest to you. Begin rolling the mat away from you, while applying pressure to the fillings to keep the roll firm. Roll the mat over slowly until it covers the rice and the near and far sides of rice join, still leaving the 3/4-inch strip of nori, rice-free, exposed. While holding the bamboo mat in position, apply pressure to the roll with your fingers to make the roll firm. Slice the roll in half, then cut both rolls twice to make 6 equal sized pieces. Repeat this process with the salmon and various fillings, nori and rice.",55,7,5,,http://lh4.ggpht.com/T3rf4wG10XSg4yiQQ4kE2fQqX07lJiaO58LndRvb3A8S4N0fXS2YsUFzcE_ooozlMPUZNtVGVNoPIbpd6yLbG5I=s730-e365
