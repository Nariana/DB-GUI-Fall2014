1,Carrot Cake,"In a mixing bowl, mix sugar, vegetable oil, and eggs. In another bowl, sift together flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Fold dry ingredients into wet mixture and blend well. Fold in carrots and chopped nuts until well blended. Distribute batter evenly into 3 (9-inch) cake layer pans, which have been generously greased. There will be approximately 1 pound 5 ounces of batter per pan. Place in preheated oven and bake for 50 to 60 minutes. Cool layers in pans, for approximately 1 hour. Store layers in pans, inverted, in closed cupboard to prevent drying. Layers must be a minimum of 1 day old.

To remove layers from baking pan, turn upside down, tap edge of pan on a hard surface. Center a 9-inch cake circle on top of revolving cake stand. Remove paper from bottom of layer cake. Place first layer, bottom side down, at center of cake stand. With a spatula, evenly spread approximately 3 1/2 ounces of frosting on the layer. Center second layer on top of first layer with topside down. Again with a spatula, evenly spread approximately 3 1/2 ounces of frosting on the layer. Center third layer on top of second layer with topside down. Using both hands, press firmly but gently, all layers together to get one firm cake. With spatula, spread remainder of frosting to cover top and sides of cake. Refrigerated until needed. Display on counter or cake stand with a plastic cover.",95,7,4
2,Beef Burger,"In a large bowl, mix ground beef, onion powder, salt and pepper until just combined. Do not overmix, or your patties will be tough.
Form patties, without pressing too hard. They should be uniform in thickness. Smooth out any cracks using your fingers. Make these right before you grill them, so they stay at room temperature.

Preheat your grill, grill pan or cast-iron skillet to high heat and add burger patties. If using a grill, cover with the lid.

Cook until the crust that forms on the bottom of the burger releases it from the pan or grate — about 2 minutes. Gently test, but don't flip it until it gets to this point. When burgers lift up easily, flip, add two slices of cheese to each, close lid if using a grill, and cook on the other side for another 2-3 minutes for medium to medium rare. 

Remove burgers with a sturdy metal spatula and transfer to a plate. Allow to rest for several minutes, then transfer to buns.

Garnish as desired and serve immediately.",25,5,5
3,Sun-dried Tomato Omelet,"In a medium bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch each of salt and pepper.",25,5,5
4,Stir-fried Egg and Tomato,"Beat eggs with 1/2 teaspoon salt until smooth but not frothy.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add eggs and cook, undisturbed, just until a thin film of cooked egg forms on bottom of skillet but most of eggs are still runny, 5 to 10 seconds. Immediately scrape eggs into a bowl. Wipe out skillet.

Heat remaining tablespoon oil in skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add scallions and stir-fry until just softened, about 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and cook, stirring and turning occasionally, until juices are released and tomatoes are slightly wilted but still intact, 4 to 6 minutes. Sprinkle sugar and 1/4 teaspoon salt over tomatoes and stir to combine. Return eggs to skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until eggs are just cooked through. Serve sprinkled with reserved scallion greens.",15,4,4

Transfer to a blender in small batches and blend until smooth.",50,10,5
6,Caesar Salad,"For the dressing: Place the anchovies into a blender or food processor. Throw in the Dijon mustard, vinegar, Worcestershire, garlic and lemon juice. Pulse the processor or blend on low speed for several seconds. Scrape down the sides.

With the food processor or blender on, drizzle the olive oil into the mixture in a small stream. Scrape down the sides. Add the Parmesan, salt and a generous grind of black pepper. Pulse the whole thing together and mix until thoroughly combined. Refrigerate the dressing for a few hours (it just gets better!) before using it on the salad.

For the croutons: Slice the bread into thick slices and cut them into 1-inch cubes. Throw them onto a baking sheet.

Heat the olive oil in a small saucepan or skillet over low heat.

Crush-but don't chop-the garlic and add them to the oil. Use a spoon to move the garlic around in the pan. After 3 to 5 minutes, turn off the heat and remove the garlic from the pan.

Slowly drizzle the olive oil over the bread cubes. Mix together with your hands, and then sprinkle lightly with salt. Toss and cook in the pan until golden brown and crisp. (Add a little butter for more flavor!)

For the salad: Wash and dry the hearts of romaine lettuce. Leave them whole. Use a vegetable peeler and shave off large, thin slices of Parmesan.

Drizzle about half of the dressing over the top of the hearts. Throw in a good handful of the Parmesan shavings. Give it a good initial toss, just so you can evaluate how much more dressing you need.

Add more dressing and Parmesan to taste. Add the cooled croutons. Toss gently.

7,Chicken-fried Chicken,"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray.

Mix together the flour and 1 teaspoon of the House Seasoning in a small bowl. Sprinkle the chicken with the remaining 1 teaspoon House Seasoning. Pour the buttermilk into a shallow dish. Dredge the chicken in the buttermilk, followed by the flour.

Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a heavy nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add half of the chicken breasts to the hot oil and cook until both sides are browned, about 3 minutes per side, and then transfer to the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining chicken breasts. Transfer the baking sheet to the oven and bake until the chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes.

Whisk together the cornstarch and 1/4 cup chicken broth until dissolved. Set aside.

To make the gravy , add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the same skillet and heat over medium heat. Add the onions and saute until translucent, about 2 minutes.

Add the remaining chicken broth, scrape the pan drippings with a wooden spoon, raise the heat to medium-high and cook until the mixture begins to bubble, about 2 minutes. Stir in the dissolved cornstarch to incorporate. Bring to a simmer and continue to cook until the mixture thickens, 4 to 5 minutes.

13,Grilled vegetables,"Place a grill pan over medium-high heat or prepare the barbecue (medium-high heat). Brush the vegetables with 1/4 cup of the oil to coat lightly. Sprinkle the vegetables with salt and pepper. Working in batches, grill the vegetables until tender and lightly charred all over, about 8 to 10 minutes for the bell peppers; 7 minutes for the yellow squash, zucchini, eggplant, and mushrooms; 4 minutes for the asparagus and green onions. Arrange the vegetables on a platter. The key to getting those great grill marks is to not shift the vegetables too frequently once they've been placed on the hot grill.

Meanwhile, whisk the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, parsley, basil, and rosemary in a small bowl to blend. Add salt and pepper to taste. Drizzle the herb mixture over the vegetables. Serve the vegetables, warm or at room temperature.",40,10,5

Meanwhile, preheat a grill or grill pan to medium and brush with olive oil. Slice the chicken breasts in half horizontally to make 4 cutlets. Coat evenly with 1/2 tablespoon olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill the chicken until well marked and cooked through, 2 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate.

Whisk in the cheese and cook until melted. Add dry mustard and season with salt and pepper. Keep warm.

Brush filets with oil on both sides and season with salt and pepper. Grill for 2 to 3 minutes on each side for rare, which is desired for this sandwich. Let rest for 5 minutes and then slice into 1/8-inch thick slices.

Slice 7/8 of the way through the rolls and fill each with several slices of the beef, cheese sauce, and any or all of the toppings. Return sandwiches to the grill, close top, and grill very briefly just to heat through.",25,9,4
16,Cookie Dough Blizzard,"Place all cookie dough ingredients (except chocolate chips) into your food processor and blend until cookie dough consistency.
Remove from food processor, place in a bowl and fold in chocolate chips.
Set aside.
In the food processor place ice cream ingredients and blend until smooth.
Add cookie dough mixture in dollops into the food processor with the ice cream.
Pulse a couple times.
Remove from food processor, feel free to top with 1 tbsp of chocolate chips, crushed nuts, and/or shredded coconut and serve.

Cookie Dough Blizzard on a Stick Directions – *Place mixture into popsicle molds and freeze overnight. Serve immediately out of the freezer as these get soft quickly.",5,9,4
17,Vegan Cheesecake,"Add dates to a food processor and blend until small bits remain and it forms into a ball. Remove and set aside.
Next add nuts and process into a meal. Then add dates back in and blend until a loose dough forms - it should stick together when you squeeze a bit between your fingers. If it's too dry, add a few more dates through the spout while processing. If too wet, add more almond or walnut meal. Optional: add a pinch of salt to taste.
Lightly grease a standard, 12 slot muffin tin. To make removing the cheesecakes easier, cut strips of parchment paper and lay them in the slots. This creates little tabs that makes removing them easier to pop out once frozen.
Next scoop in heaping 1 Tbsp amounts of crust and press with fingers. To pack it down, use a small glass or the back of a spoon to compact it and really press it down. I found the bottom of a glass works well. If it sticks, separate the crust and the glass with a small piece of parchment. Set in freezer to firm up.
Add all filling ingredients to a blender and mix until very smooth. For the coconut milk, I like to scoop the ""cream"" off the top because it provides a richer texture. But if yours is already all mixed together, just add it in as is.
You don't need a Vitamix for this recipe, just a quality blender. I mixed mine for 1 minute, then ""liquified"" or ""pureed"" it until silky smooth. If it won't come together, add a touch more lemon juice or agave or a splash more coconut milk liquid as the liquid should help it blend better.
Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. If adding peanut butter, add to the blender and mix until thoroughly combined. If flavoring with blueberry or caramel, wait and swirl on top of plain cheesecakes (optional).
Divide filling evenly among the muffin tins. Tap a few times to release any air bubbles, then cover with plastic wrap and freeze until hard - about 4-6 hours.
Once set, remove by tugging on the tabs or loosening them with a butter knife. They should pop right out. Our favorite way to devour these was with a little more caramel and a touch of coconut whipped cream. But they're perfect as is! Keep in the freezer for up to 1-2 weeks.
Optional: you can set them out for 10 minutes before serving to soften.",20,8,5
